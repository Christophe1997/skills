# Writing Hugo Blog

## Overview

This skill enables creation of Chinese blog posts for the Neo VRAINS Hugo blog. Articles are generated based on user queries, research results, or conversation content, following the blog's established format and style guidelines.

## Blog Structure

### Location
- Articles are stored in `content/posts/YYYY/` (year-based subdirectories)
- Example: `content/posts/2026/my-article.md`

### Front Matter Format

All blog posts use YAML front matter with these required fields:

```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+08:00
draft: false
author: "小蓝"
categories: ["Things I Learned"]
showToc: true
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
---
```

**Field descriptions:**
- `title`: Chinese article title (required)
- `date`: Publication date in ISO 8601 format (required)
- `draft`: Set to `false` for published posts, `true` for drafts
- `author`: Article author (required, should be "小蓝")
- `categories`: Typically ["Things I Learned"] or other category names
- `showToc`: Enable table of contents for longer articles
- `tags`: Relevant tags for content discoverability (array of strings)

### Article Content Guidelines

1. **Language**: Simplified Chinese, natural and fluent writing style
2. **Length**: Concise and focused, typically 500-1500 words
3. **Structure**: Clear headings, logical flow, short paragraphs
4. **AI Content Labeling**: Every article generated by AI MUST include this disclaimer at the end:

```markdown
---

*本文包含AI生成内容*
```

5. **Code examples**: When including code, use proper syntax highlighting with language tags

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Article Context

- Understand the user's intent: research summary, technical tutorial, reflection, or insight
- Identify key points from the query, reading results, or conversation
- Determine appropriate tags and categories based on content

### Step 2: Generate Article

1. **Create front matter** with proper YAML format
2. **Write article body** in Chinese with:
   - Engaging title that reflects content
   - Clear introduction setting context
   - Well-structured body with headings
   - Concise conclusion or key takeaways
3. **Add AI content disclaimer** at the end
4. **Set publication date** to current time in China timezone (+08:00)

### Step 3: Save Article

1. Determine the year for the article directory (current year)
2. Create a descriptive filename in lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `my-article.md`)
3. Save to `content/posts/YYYY/` directory
4. Verify file structure matches other blog posts

### Step 4: Verification

Check that:
- Front matter is valid YAML
- Date format is correct: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+08:00`
- Article contains AI content disclaimer
- File is in correct directory structure
- Markdown syntax is valid

## Examples

### Technical Article

```yaml
---
title: "使用 Hugo 构建静态博客"
date: 2026-02-14T01:30:00+08:00
draft: false
author: "小蓝"
categories: ["Things I Learned"]
showToc: true
tags: ["Hugo", "Static Site Generator", "Web Development"]
---
```

### Research Summary

```yaml
---
title: "AI 辅助编程的实践经验"
date: 2026-02-14T02:00:00+08:00
draft: false
author: "小蓝"
categories: ["Things I Learned"]
showToc: true
tags: ["AI", "Programming", "Productivity"]
---
```

## Writing Style

- **Tone**: Professional yet conversational, similar to technical blog posts
- **Voice**: First-person perspective when sharing personal insights
- **Clarity**: Explain technical concepts simply but accurately
- **Engagement**: Use examples and practical applications when possible
- **Brevity**: Respect the reader's time, avoid unnecessary elaboration

## Reference Information

### Common Categories
- "Things I Learned" - Technical tutorials and insights
- Create new categories as needed based on article type

### Content Organization
- `content/posts/YYYY/` - Blog posts organized by year
- `content/archives.md` - Archives page (if applicable)
- Front matter consistency is important for proper indexing

### Blog Configuration (User-Specific)

**Before creating articles, read the blog configuration to understand:**

1. **Config file location**: Hugo supports multiple config file formats:
   - `config.yml` (YAML)
   - `config.toml` (TOML)
   - `config.yaml` (YAML, alternative)
   - `config.json` (JSON)

2. **Key configuration values** (from `config.yml`):
   ```yaml
   baseURL: "https://www.sdlinks.net"  # Blog URL
   title: "Neo VRAINS"                 # Site title
   theme: hugo-PaperMod               # Theme used

   params:
     title: "Neo VRAINS"
     author: Christophe                # Default author
   ```

3. **Reading configuration**: Always check the actual config file in the blog root directory before generating content. This ensures articles match the blog's settings and style.

These settings vary by user and should be read dynamically from the config file, not hardcoded.
